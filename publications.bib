   abstract = {Background: Globalization has resulted in a growing bilingual population worldwide; thus, bilingual speakers with aphasia are also increasing. The ability to juggle languages has been reported to enhance attentional control abilities in healthy populations. However, few studies have looked at the impact of bilingualism on attentional control abilities in individuals with aphasia. Different subcomponents of attention are seldom studied in bilingual aphasia. Aims: The goal of the study is to explore the influence of bilingualism on three subcomponents of attention in individuals with aphasia, namely alerting, orienting and executive control. The study aimed to examine whether (1) individuals with aphasia show evidence of an attentional de?cit in comparison to language-matched healthy peers, (2) there is evidence of a bilingual advantage in attentional mechanisms, and (3) there is a relationship between bilingualism and subcomponents of attention. Methods and Procedures: All the participants (10 French-English bilingual and 7 French monolingual adults with aphasia and 32 monolingual and bilingual healthy controls) performed a behavioural version of the Attention Network Test. The efficiency of the three attentional networks was assessed by measuring how response times varied with different warning cues and flanker type, resulting in alerting, orienting and executive control effects. Objective and subjective measures of bilingualism were also included. Results: Results confirmed a bilingual advantage in attentional mechanisms with and without aphasia. More specifically, group difference for healthy controls was evident in the accuracy rate only. For individuals with aphasia, between-group comparisons revealed differences in alerting ability: the bilingual group presented a significantly greater difference score than the monolingual group in the mu (mu) component of the response time distribution, whereas the monolingual group was able to take advantage of the alerting cue in the tau (tau) component. Furthermore, the monolingual and bilingual speakers with aphasia exhibited reduced alerting and more interference effect when compared to their respective healthy controls. Conclusions: This study provides evidence that bilingualism impacts attentional mechanisms in individuals with aphasia as well as healthy controls. Specifically, bilingual individuals with aphasia showed more efficient alerting skills than monolinguals with aphasia. Ex-Gaussian data analysis revealed effects that might otherwise be thought to be non-existent. Considering the growing bilingual population, an understanding of the behavioural signs and symptoms of attentional abilities in individuals with aphasia is necessary for both theoretical and clinical purposes.},

   abstract = {A tight coupling of language and motor processes has been established, which is consistent with embodied cognition theory. However, very few therapies have been designed to exploit the synergy between motor and language processes to help rehabilitate people with aphasia (PWA). Moreover, the underlying mechanisms supporting the efficacy of such approaches remain unknown. Previous work in our laboratory has demonstrated that personalized observation, execution, and mental imagery therapy (POEM)-a new therapy using three sensorimotor strategies to trigger action verb naming-leads to significant improvements in verb retrieval in PWA. Moreover, these improvements were supported by significant activations in language and sensorimotor processing areas, which further reinforce the role of both processes in language recovery (Durand et al., 2018). The present study investigates resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) changes following POEM in a pre-/post-POEM therapy design. A whole brain network functional connectivity approach was used to assess and describe changes in rsFC in a group of four PWA, who were matched and compared with four healthy controls (HC). Results showed increased rsFC in PWA within and between visuo-motor and language areas (right cuneal cortex-left supracalcarin (SCC) cortex/right precentral gyrus (PreCG)-left lingual gyrus (LG)) and between areas involved in action processing (right anterior parahippocampal gyrus (aPaHC)-left superior parietal lobule (SPL). In comparison to HC, the PWA group showed increased rsFC between the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and left thalamus, which are areas involved in lexico-semantic processing. This proof-of-concept study suggests that the sensorimotor and language strategies used in POEM may induce modifications in large-scale networks, probably derived from the integration of visual and sensorimotor systems to sustain action naming, which is consistent with the embodied cognition theory.},

   abstract = {Studies show bilingualism entails an advantage in cognitive control tasks. There is evidence of a bilingual advantage in the context of aphasia, resulting in better cognitive outcomes and recovery in bilingual persons with aphasia compared to monolingual peers. This bilingual advantage also results in structural changes in the right hemisphere gray matter. Very few studies have examined the so-called bilingual advantage by reference to specific anomia therapy efficacy. This study aims to compare the effect of French-Phonological Component Analysis (Fr-PCA) in monolinguals and bilingual persons with aphasia, both at the linguistic and cognitive control level, and to examine the structural impact of left hemisphere lesion location and right hemisphere structural data. Eight participants with chronic aphasia received Fr-PCA for a total of 15 h over 5 weeks. The results showed improved accuracy for treated words and generalization to untreated items and discourse in both groups, and improved Flanker task performance for some participants. Bilingual participants improved more than monolinguals for picture-naming tasks and narrative discourse. Damage to the left postcentral gyrus and the middle frontal gyrus was associated with less therapy-induced improvement. Additionally, left hemisphere damage to the inferior parietal gyrus and postcentral gyrus was associated with reduced cognitive control pre-therapy. Undamaged right hemisphere cortical thicknesses were significantly different between groups; the inferior frontal gyrus and the middle frontal gyrus were greater for the bilingual participants and correlated with cognitive control skills. These results suggest a bilingual advantage in anomia recovery following Fr-PCA, potentially resulting from enhanced cognitive control abilities that could be supported by right hemisphere neural reserve.},

   abstract = {Anomia is the most frequent and pervasive symptom for people with aphasia (PWA). Phonological component analysis (PCA) is a therapy incorporating phonological cues to treat anomia. Investigations of neural correlates supporting improvements following PCA remain scarce. Resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) as a marker of therapy-induced neuroplasticity has been reported by our team. The present study explores the efficacy of PCA in French and associated therapy-induced neuroplasticity using whole-brain rsFC analysis. Ten PWA participated in a pre-/post-PCA fMRI study with cognitive linguistic assessments. PCA was delivered in French following the standard procedure. PCA led to significant improvement with trained and untrained items. PCA also led to changes in rsFC between distributed ROIs in the semantic network, visual network, and sub-cortical areas. Changes in rsFC can be interpreted within the frame of the visual and phonological nature of PCA. Behavioral and rsFC data changes associated with PCA in French highlight its efficacy and point to the importance of phonological and orthographic cues to consolidate the word-retrieval strategy, contributing to generalization to untrained words.},
