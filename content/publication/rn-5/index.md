abstract: 'Background: Globalization has resulted in a growing bilingual population
  worldwide; thus, bilingual speakers with aphasia are also increasing. The ability
  to juggle languages has been reported to enhance attentional control abilities in
  healthy populations. However, few studies have looked at the impact of bilingualism
  on attentional control abilities in individuals with aphasia. Different subcomponents
  of attention are seldom studied in bilingual aphasia. Aims: The goal of the study
  is to explore the influence of bilingualism on three subcomponents of attention
  in individuals with aphasia, namely alerting, orienting and executive control. The
  study aimed to examine whether (1) individuals with aphasia show evidence of an
  attentional de?cit in comparison to language-matched healthy peers, (2) there is
  evidence of a bilingual advantage in attentional mechanisms, and (3) there is a
  relationship between bilingualism and subcomponents of attention. Methods and Procedures:
  All the participants (10 French-English bilingual and 7 French monolingual adults
  with aphasia and 32 monolingual and bilingual healthy controls) performed a behavioural
  version of the Attention Network Test. The efficiency of the three attentional networks
  was assessed by measuring how response times varied with different warning cues
  and flanker type, resulting in alerting, orienting and executive control effects.
  Objective and subjective measures of bilingualism were also included. Results: Results
  confirmed a bilingual advantage in attentional mechanisms with and without aphasia.
  More specifically, group difference for healthy controls was evident in the accuracy
  rate only. For individuals with aphasia, between-group comparisons revealed differences
  in alerting ability: the bilingual group presented a significantly greater difference
  score than the monolingual group in the mu (mu) component of the response time distribution,
  whereas the monolingual group was able to take advantage of the alerting cue in
  the tau (tau) component. Furthermore, the monolingual and bilingual speakers with
  aphasia exhibited reduced alerting and more interference effect when compared to
  their respective healthy controls. Conclusions: This study provides evidence that
  bilingualism impacts attentional mechanisms in individuals with aphasia as well
  as healthy controls. Specifically, bilingual individuals with aphasia showed more
  efficient alerting skills than monolinguals with aphasia. Ex-Gaussian data analysis
  revealed effects that might otherwise be thought to be non-existent. Considering
  the growing bilingual population, an understanding of the behavioural signs and
  symptoms of attentional abilities in individuals with aphasia is necessary for both
  theoretical and clinical purposes.'
