abstract: Anomia is the most frequent and pervasive symptom for people with aphasia
  (PWA). Phonological component analysis (PCA) is a therapy incorporating phonological
  cues to treat anomia. Investigations of neural correlates supporting improvements
  following PCA remain scarce. Resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) as a marker
  of therapy-induced neuroplasticity has been reported by our team. The present study
  explores the efficacy of PCA in French and associated therapy-induced neuroplasticity
  using whole-brain rsFC analysis. Ten PWA participated in a pre-/post-PCA fMRI study
  with cognitive linguistic assessments. PCA was delivered in French following the
  standard procedure. PCA led to significant improvement with trained and untrained
  items. PCA also led to changes in rsFC between distributed ROIs in the semantic
  network, visual network, and sub-cortical areas. Changes in rsFC can be interpreted
  within the frame of the visual and phonological nature of PCA. Behavioral and rsFC
  data changes associated with PCA in French highlight its efficacy and point to the
  importance of phonological and orthographic cues to consolidate the word-retrieval
  strategy, contributing to generalization to untrained words.
