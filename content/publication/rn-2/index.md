abstract: Studies show bilingualism entails an advantage in cognitive control tasks.
  There is evidence of a bilingual advantage in the context of aphasia, resulting
  in better cognitive outcomes and recovery in bilingual persons with aphasia compared
  to monolingual peers. This bilingual advantage also results in structural changes
  in the right hemisphere gray matter. Very few studies have examined the so-called
  bilingual advantage by reference to specific anomia therapy efficacy. This study
  aims to compare the effect of French-Phonological Component Analysis (Fr-PCA) in
  monolinguals and bilingual persons with aphasia, both at the linguistic and cognitive
  control level, and to examine the structural impact of left hemisphere lesion location
  and right hemisphere structural data. Eight participants with chronic aphasia received
  Fr-PCA for a total of 15 h over 5 weeks. The results showed improved accuracy for
  treated words and generalization to untreated items and discourse in both groups,
  and improved Flanker task performance for some participants. Bilingual participants
  improved more than monolinguals for picture-naming tasks and narrative discourse.
  Damage to the left postcentral gyrus and the middle frontal gyrus was associated
  with less therapy-induced improvement. Additionally, left hemisphere damage to the
  inferior parietal gyrus and postcentral gyrus was associated with reduced cognitive
  control pre-therapy. Undamaged right hemisphere cortical thicknesses were significantly
  different between groups; the inferior frontal gyrus and the middle frontal gyrus
  were greater for the bilingual participants and correlated with cognitive control
  skills. These results suggest a bilingual advantage in anomia recovery following
  Fr-PCA, potentially resulting from enhanced cognitive control abilities that could
  be supported by right hemisphere neural reserve.
